# Space-Debris-Risk-Assessment
Built a FastAPI backend that analyzes and predicts orbital debris collision risks using Kalman filters, TLE data parsing, and machine learning models for trajectory prediction. Designed APIs for satellite data ingestion, debris risk computation, and real-time alert generation to support scalable aerospace applications.
